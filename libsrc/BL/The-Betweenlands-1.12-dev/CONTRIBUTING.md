# Pull Requests

Hi! Thanks for taking your time to create a pull request.  
There are a few rules we would like you to follow:  

1. Make sure that your changes are correct and work as intended. Please do sufficient testing.
2. If your pull request is a work in progress please create it as a [draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
3. If you want to add new content please discuss it with us developers first. It would be unfortunate if you worked on new content only for it
to not be accepted later on. If you really are serious about developing or maintaining content for the Betweenlands you are probably better off
asking to join our team.

With that said, we appreciate every bit of help!

### Choosing the right branch

Choosing the right branch is important because it makes it easier for both you and for us to get your pull request merged.  
There are two main branches that are usually being worked on. Their names are composed of the minecraft version with a `dev` or `fixes` suffix
(e.g. `1.12-dev` and `1.12-fixes`).  
New gameplay content and features are generally being developed on the `dev` branch and small fixes or
changes for the latest released version go on the `fixes` branch.  
In short:  
- `fixes`: Fixes, **but also localizations/translations, texture changes, etc.** go on the `fixes` branch so that they can be released as soon as possible.
- `dev`: New content such as mobs, blocks, etc.
